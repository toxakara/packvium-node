# Changelog

What changed in `@packvium/engine` on npm, release by release. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/1.1.0/) and this project adheres to
[Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.0]

Portable operational artifacts, and a faster `quality` profile. Nothing breaks 1.2.0.

### Added

- **`@packvium/engine/artifacts.js`** — `buildOperationalArtifact(request, result, { loadingOrders })`
  and `canonicalArtifactJson()`. One `packvium-operational-artifact/v1` document carries the
  execution plan, exact geometry, the values a work order shows, and the request that produced
  it. Every Packvium engine builds the same bytes from the same result.
- **`@packvium/engine/artifact-exports.js`** — `exportJson`, `exportCsv` (RFC 4180, 18 columns)
  and `exportWorkOrderHtml`: a printable work order in one HTML file with no scripts and no
  external resources.
- TypeScript declarations for both, and `examples/artifacts.mjs`.

### Changed

- **The beam search behind `solver_profile: "quality"` does less repeated work.** Results are
  byte-identical. On the wide cases measured (48 items, beam width 12) it took about half the
  time and 34–49 MB less memory.
- A pinned catalog version resolves without scanning the version history.
- `canonicalPlanJson` writes RFC 8785 through the same writer as the artifact. Every plan the
  engine produces keeps its 1.2.0 bytes.

## [1.2.0]

Execution plans, and a fix for items going missing on the `quality` profile. Nothing breaks 1.1.0.

### Added

- **`@packvium/engine/execution.js`** — `buildExecutionPlan(request, result, { loadingOrders })`,
  `canonicalPlanJson(plan)` and `placementReference()`, with TypeScript declarations. Turns a
  validated result into a work order: what to lift, why a carton was chosen, what was not
  packed. Step order comes from `loadingOrders` or is reported as `"unavailable"`.
- `examples/execution.mjs`.

### Fixed

- **The JavaScript engine could return fewer placements than it reported packed.** With
  `solver_profile: "quality"` or `container_plan_beam_width` above 1, a beam search that stopped
  early dropped the items it had not reached: neither placed nor listed as unpacked, and the
  result still said `feasible`. Affected `1.0.0` and `1.1.0`; the default profiles were not.
  If you used the `quality` profile, compare `packed_item_count` with the placements you received.

## Earlier releases
